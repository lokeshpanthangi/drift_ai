## Project info

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Set up environment variables
# Copy the example .env file and configure it
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file and set VITE_API_BASE_URL to your backend URL

# Step 5: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

## Environment Configuration

This project requires environment variables to connect to the backend API. 

**Required Environment Variables:**

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - The base URL of your FastAPI backend server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)

**Setup:**

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and set the backend URL:
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. For production, create `.env.production` with your production backend URL

**Note:** The application will throw an error if `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is not set, ensuring you never accidentally use a hardcoded URL.

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
